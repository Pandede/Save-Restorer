# SaveRestorer
Backup the save files

## Motivation
Just used for backup the save of games, especially the game which published by FROMSOFTWARE (It's 2020 and FROMSOFTWARE still does not support cloud saving, GITGUD)

## Instruction
1. Open the terminal and type ```python main.py```
2. Press 'Add...' to add the path of save.
3. Press 'Backup...', enter the export path and press 'OK'
4. GITGUD

## Note
It's just a practice of building GUI with PYTHON, maybe I'll add the feature which allows the save upload to Google Drive or Dropbox soon.
